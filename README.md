# Social-Media-Mental-Health-Indicators-Dataset

## Description:
This project explores the relationship between social media usage patterns and mental health indicators through data-driven analysis. Using Python libraries and guided by data science principles, I conducted an exploratory analysis to uncover insights into user behavior, emotional well-being, sleep patterns, and demographic factors.
The goal of this project is to better understand how different aspects of social media engagement—such as screen time and interaction quality—can influence mental health outcomes. The findings may help raise awareness about healthy digital habits and support data-informed discussions around mental well-being.

### Technologies:
Python (Data analysis and visualization)
Libraries: Pandas (Data manipulation), NumPy (Numerical computing)

### Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is available publicly on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sonalshinde123/social-media-mental-health-indicators-dataset

### It includes variables related to:
- Daily social media usage and screen time  
- Positive and negative social media interactions  
- Emotional and mental health indicators  
- Sleep duration  
- Demographic information (age, gender)

### I conducted exploratory data analysis and obtained the following key insights:
- Teenagers and young adults spend more time on social media compared to older age groups.
- Higher daily screen time is associated with more negative mental health indicators.
- Positive social media interactions correlate with improved emotional well-being.
- Negative interactions show a clear association with increased stress levels.
- Individuals with longer and healthier sleep durations tend to report lower stress.
- Gender distribution is nearly balanced, and no major mental health differences were observed between genders.
- Older users generally display more controlled social media usage patterns.

These findings suggest that both the amount and quality of social media usage play an important role in mental health.
